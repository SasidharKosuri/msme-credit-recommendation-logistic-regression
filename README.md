# 📌 MSME Credit Recommendation System (Logistic Regression from Scratch)

This project implements a credit approval prediction system for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) using Logistic Regression built entirely from scratch — without using scikit-learn.
It uses NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, along with manual Gradient Descent, to train a logistic regression classifier that predicts whether a business should be approved for a loan based on key financial and operational features.
